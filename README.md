## Introduction

In this assignment, you'll create a basic HTML web page that allows users to input product details, such as the product name, product brand, and price. The web page will calculate the total price based on different discount percentages for specific product brands.

## Assignment Description

The HTML page includes a form with fields for product name, product brand, and price. When the user submits the form, JavaScript code will calculate the total price based on the following rules:

- If the product brand is "Apple," a 5% discount will be applied.
- If the product brand is "Samsung," a 10% discount will be applied.

The web page will display the product name, product brand, original price, applied discount, and the total price.
